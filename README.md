This is my first project aiming to ensure the health of both hardware and software is optimal before being resold. 

I have plans to add more to this script in the future.
As of now, the script mainly runs baked in command prompt commands or powershell commands to check and restore any winows .iso issues
Currently there should be a loading bar for each script, asking the user if they want to move forward to prevent the same commands run over and over again. 

This is my first official project, I barely understand scripting languages as a whole.
Im hoping this works without any permissions/profiles on the image, this is mainly ment to simplify the process after a fresh windows install.
